### Edit Asset Package

If you need to edit a package select a package and press Space key to open the Asset Editor.

![image]({{site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}assets/media/clayman_editor.png){: width="750" }

If you change the name of the package - it gets moved on the filesystem level! So be careful with renameing packages!

You can add or remove items from the packages, change the tags or description.

If you want to rebuild the package instead check the Rebuild package help.
