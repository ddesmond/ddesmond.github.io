The complaint is submitted via e-mail aleks.katunar at gmail.com or via phone +386 68 169 816. The complaint processing procedure is confidential. Clayman will confirm within five working days that it has received a complaint, notify the customer how long it will take to handle it and keep him/her informed about the progress of the procedure. Clayman is aware that the essential characteristic of the consumer dispute, at least as far as the judicial solution is concerned, is its disproportion between the economic value of the claim and the costs incurred in resolving the dispute itself. This is also the main obstacle, that the consumer does not initiate a dispute in front of a court. Because of that, Clayman always strives to do its best to resolve any dispute by mutual consent. In the case of judicial settlement of disputes, the court shall have jurisdiction in the municipality of the customer.

#### OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT OF CONSUMER DISPUTES

The platform is available to consumers here.
